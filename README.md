## Overview

The **NSFW Image Detection** model is designed to help developers and researchers filter and categorize image content effectively. It is built on the `SiglipForImageClassification` architecture and aims to provide a reliable solution for identifying inappropriate content. 

This project can be particularly useful for applications that require content moderation, parental controls, or user-generated content platforms. 

## Features

- **Multi-class Classification**: The model can identify various content types, including explicit, suggestive, and safe media.
- **Easy Integration**: Built with popular libraries like Hugging Face Transformers, making it easy to integrate into existing projects.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Utilize Gradio for a simple web interface to interact with the model.
- **High Accuracy**: Fine-tuned on a comprehensive dataset to ensure reliable detection results.

## Installation

To get started, you need to install the necessary dependencies. You can do this using pip. 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine.

## Usage

To use the NSFW Image Detection model, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pedropqv/nsfw-image-detection.git
   cd nsfw-image-detection
   ```

2. **Run the Gradio app**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Access the web interface**: Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:7860` to start using the model.

You can upload images and see the classification results in real-time.

## Model Training

If you're interested in training the model further, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your dataset**: Make sure your images are organized into folders based on their categories (e.g., explicit, suggestive, safe).
  
2. **Update the configuration file**: Modify the `config.yaml` file to point to your dataset.

3. **Start training**:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

4. **Monitor the training process**: You can check the logs for any issues and track the training progress.

5. **Save the model**: Once training is complete, make sure to save your model for future use.
